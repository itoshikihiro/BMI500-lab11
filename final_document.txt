In this program,

First, I use TotalDiag to transform data from dx0 to dx24 to percentage. The calculate is like dx0/TotalDiag * 100;

Second, I put one-to-many entries into groups in I10-I9 mapping file. Each group shares one common I10 name, and multiple I9 names. 

Then, I find out the max percentage in each row storing in "max_percentage" and creat another column "max_single_diagonsis" to store the value calcuated by "max_percentage" * "max_single_diagonsis" in each group. 

Consider there are some one-to-many mappings does not have frequency data. In this situation, the program randomly choose one of I9 names for that particular I10 name. 

Finally, the program finds out the maximum of "max_single_diagonsis" in each group. The I9 name of the maximum would be the exact mapping name of that group's I10 name. 

One cosideration is that "TotalDiag" does not represent a single diagonsis's popularity. If a person had some I10 diease, the most curable way is to find max_single_diagnosis in I9.
